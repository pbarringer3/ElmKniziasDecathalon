# HundredMeters

## About
Reiner Knizia's Decathalon is a series of 10 minigames played with dice. The rules are freely available on the designer's website. This project is starting with the first game and will eventually encompass all ten.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to give me experience in building an actual project in Elm. The idea was inspired by my work as an instructor at Art of Problem Solving where we use this series of games to help students learn to program in the course Intermediate Programming with Python. 

I decided on this project after reading most of the guide and going back to work on the exercises from Random.

It will begin with a single game from the Decathalon and build from there.

## Rules

## Current Deficiencies (to work on)
The UI isn't very nice. I'd like to clean it up, especially lining up "Total:" vertically with "Value:" and having the numbers align with each other on the right. I'd also like to play with the styling of the buttons and change the cursor when it hovers over "Rules"

I still need to implement responsive design as it currently is only optimized for a desktop monitor.
