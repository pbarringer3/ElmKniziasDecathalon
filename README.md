# ElmKniziasDecathalon

## About
Reiner Knizia's Decathalon is a series of 10 minigames played with dice. The rules are freely available on the designer's website.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to give me experience in building an actual project in Elm. The idea was inspired by my work as an instructor at Art of Problem Solving where we use this series of games to help students learn to program in the course Intermediate Programming with Python. 

I decided on this project after reading most of the guide and going back to work on the exercises from Random.

It will begin with a single game from the Decathalon and build from there.
